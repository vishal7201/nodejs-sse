# nodejs-sse
 Server Side Events (SSE).SSE is a mechanism that allows the server to asynchronously push the data to the client once the client-server connection is established. The server can then decide to send data whenever a new “chunk” of data is available. It can be considered as a one-way publish-subscribe model. It also offers a standard JavaScript client API named EventSource implemented in most modern browsers as part of the HTML5 standard by W3C.
